# Framework Documentation

## Authentication System

### User Roles
The framework supports multiple user roles:
- Admin
- Regular User

### User Properties
Users in the system have the following attributes:
- id: Unique identifier
- username: User's login name
- email: User's email address
- password: Encrypted password (using bcrypt with cost factor 10)
- role: User's role (admin/user)
- created_at: Account creation timestamp
- updated_at: Last update timestamp
- remember_token: Token for "Remember Me" functionality
- email_verified_at: Email verification timestamp
- is_active: Account status flag
- token_expires_at: Authentication token expiration
- last_activity: Last user activity timestamp

### Authentication Features
1. Secure Login System
   - Password encryption using bcrypt
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management
   - Activity logging

2. Security Features
   - Password hashing
   - Token-based authentication
   - Email verification
   - Account activity tracking
   - Session timeout management

### Login Process
The system logs all login attempts with the following information:
- Success/failure status
- User details (if successful)
- Role verification
- Timestamp

## Best Practices
1. Password Security
   - All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Strong password encryption with salt

2. Session Management
   - Token-based authentication
   - Expiration handling
   - Remember me functionality

3. User Management
   - Active status tracking
   - Email verification
   - Last activity monitoring
   - Role-based permissions

## System Requirements
- PHP with bcrypt support
- Database system (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)

## Security Considerations
1. Password Storage
   - Passwords are never stored in plain text
   - Uses secure hashing algorithm (bcrypt)

2. Access Control
   - Role-based access control
   - Separate admin and user privileges
   - Activity logging for security audit

3. Session Security
   - Token expiration
   - Activity timeout
   - Secure session handling

## Maintenance
- Regular security updates recommended
- Monitor auth_debug.log for suspicious activities
- Regular backup of user data
- Periodic security audits
